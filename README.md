ðŸš¦ Welcome to the Traffic Signal Recognition Project!  ðŸš€
If you're passionate about computer vision and AI, this project is perfect for you. Contribute to the development of an advanced system that detects and classifies traffic signals in real-time, improving traffic flow and ensuring driver and pedestrian safety.

Project Overview
The Traffic Signal Recognition Project leverages state-of-the-art technologies to address the challenges associated with traffic signal detection and classification. The project focuses on the following key areas:

1). Data Collection: We gather a comprehensive dataset of traffic signal images, encompassing various traffic signal types, lighting conditions, and perspectives. This diverse dataset is crucial for training robust and reliable models.

2). Model Development: We employ computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to develop models capable of accurately detecting and classifying traffic signals. Our models leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced image processing techniques to achieve high-performance results.

3). Model Training and Evaluation: The developed models are trained on the collected dataset and rigorously evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This ensures the models' effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

4). Real-time Implementation: We strive to deploy the trained models in a real-time system capable of processing traffic signal images in milliseconds. This implementation enables practical use cases, including integration with autonomous vehicles, smart traffic management systems, and pedestrian safety applications.
